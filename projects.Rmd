## The metabolic consequences of adverse early life conditions and subsequent risk for adult type 2 diabetes

This is my main funded research. The aim is to investigate how early life 
conditions influence adult metabolic capacity and ultimately risk for type 2 
diabetes. I'll be using data from Denmark's registers and linking to some
cohort studies to apply causal structure learning methods to identify pathways
between early life, adult metabolic characteristics, and diabetes. There are
several sub-projects related to this main project:

1. Denmark statistics application and study protocol: [gitlab.com/lwjohnst/meld-protocol](https://gitlab.com/lwjohnst/meld-protocol).
2. R package development for the statistical method: [NetCoupler](https://github.com/NetCoupler/NetCoupler)
3. An analysis of the [UK Biobank](https://gitlab.com/lwjohnst/ecc.cmd.ukbiobank/)
and [InterAct](https://gitlab.com/lwjohnst/ecc.mp.dm)
using NetCoupler to build the pipeline for the data analysis of the 
register datasets.

## Improving data analysis and reproducibility within science

There are several projects that fall under this project heading. The main aim is
to make reproducible and open science the default by making it the easiest,
simplest, and fastest approach to doing science. These projects fall under (for
now) three areas:

1. **Documentation**: Create and develop a philosophy (a "manifesto") to
explicitly state how reproducible and open science should be conducted from a
practical point of view. Currently being developed at 
[`rostools/manifesto`](https://rostools.gitlab.io/manifesto/).
1. **R Packages**: Using the manifesto as a guide, to build an ecosystem of
tools that automate as many aspects of doing an open and reproducible research
project and streamlining many other aspects. An example of one of these packages
is the [prodigenr](https://github.com/rostools/prodigenr) package.
1. **Teaching**: 
To integrate the
ecosystem of R packages with a set of beginner-friendly and accessible
training materials and documentation that future and current scientists can
use to learn how to conduct reproducible and open science easily and simply.
Developing and running workshops aimed at teaching researchers
modern tools and skills to work openly and reproducibly. For an example of one
of these projects, check out the [`r-cubed`](https://r-cubed.rostools.org/) 
teaching material.
    - Other projects related to teaching include two (completed and planned)
    books of teaching material for Research Software Engineering in R and
    Python and two books of teaching material for Novice R and Python. See
    the main website [Merely Useful](https://merely-useful.github.io/) for 
    links to these books.
