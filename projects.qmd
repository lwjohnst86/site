## Seedcase Project: An open and scalable software framework for health research data

This is a software project where we aim to build an open source data
infrastructure framework that makes it easier to connect data
collectors, researchers, clinicians, and the general public, with the
data, documentation, and findings within health studies. We are creating
this framework in a way that allows other research groups and companies,
who might be unable to adequately invest in building infrastructures of
this type on their own, to relatively easily implement it, and modify as
needed, for their own purposes. Check out the [project
website](https://seedcase-project.org) for a detailed description of
what we are and will be doing.

## Improving data analysis and reproducibility within science

There are several projects that fall under this project heading. The
main aim is to make reproducible and open science the default by making
it the easiest, simplest, and fastest approach to doing science. These
projects fall under (for now) three areas:

1.  **Documentation**: Create and develop a philosophy (a "manifesto")
    to explicitly state how reproducible and open science should be
    conducted from a practical point of view. Currently (slowly) being
    developed at
    [`rostools/manifesto`](https://rostools.gitlab.io/manifesto/).
2.  **R Packages**: Using the manifesto as a guide, to build an
    ecosystem of tools that automate as many aspects of doing an open
    and reproducible research project and streamlining many other
    aspects. An example of one of these packages is the
    [prodigenr](https://github.com/rostools/prodigenr) package.
3.  **Teaching**: To integrate the ecosystem of R packages with a set of
    beginner-friendly and accessible training materials and
    documentation that future and current scientists can use to learn
    how to conduct reproducible and open science easily and simply.
    Developing and running workshops aimed at teaching researchers
    modern tools and skills to work openly and reproducibly. For an
    example of one of these projects, check out the
    [`r-cubed`](https://r-cubed.rostools.org/) teaching material for
    three courses in R.

## DP-Next: Sustainable Type 2 Diabetes Prevention for the 21st Century

We received a grant from a Steno National Collaborative grant from Novo
Nordisk Foundation to develop a sustainably effective strategy for
prevention of Type 2 Diabetes in Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe
Islands. We collaborate across all Danish Steno Diabetes Centers. A more
detailed overview of this project can be found on our [project
website](https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dp-next/).

My role is as lead for Work Package 1, which aims to build up the
operational and reproducible aspects of collecting data, running
analyses, and publishing results. See the
[page](https://steno-aarhus.github.io/dp-next/wp1/) on the project
website for more details.
