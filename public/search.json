      "contents": "\nA\nframework for an open and scalable infrastructure for health data\nexemplified by the DD2 initiative\nThis is a software project where we aim to build an open source data\ninfrastructure framework that makes it easier to connect data\ncollectors, researchers, clinicians, and the general public, with the\ndata, documentation, and findings within health studies. We will be\ncreating this framework in such a way that other research groups and\ncompanies, who might be unable to adequately invest in building\ninfrastructures of this type on their own, can relatively easily\nimplement it, and modify as needed, for their own purposes. Check out\nthe project\nwebsite for a detailed description of what we will be doing.\nThe\nmetabolic consequences of adverse early life conditions and subsequent\nrisk for adult type 2 diabetes\nThis is my main ‚Äòclassic‚Äô research. The aim is to investigate how\nearly life conditions influence adult metabolic capacity and ultimately\nrisk for type 2 diabetes. I‚Äôll be using data from Denmark‚Äôs registers\nand linking to some cohort studies to apply causal structure learning\nmethods to identify pathways between early life, adult metabolic\ncharacteristics, and diabetes. There are several sub-projects related to\nthis main project:\nDenmark statistics application and study protocol: gitlab.com/lwjohnst/meld-protocol.\nR package development for the statistical method: NetCoupler\nAn analysis of the UK Biobank and\nInterAct data using\nNetCoupler to build the pipeline for the data analysis of the register\ndatasets.\nImproving\ndata analysis and reproducibility within science\nThere are several projects that fall under this project heading. The\nmain aim is to make reproducible and open science the default by making\nit the easiest, simplest, and fastest approach to doing science. These\nprojects fall under (for now) three areas:\nDocumentation: Create and develop a philosophy (a\n‚Äúmanifesto‚Äù) to explicitly state how reproducible and open science\nshould be conducted from a practical point of view. Currently (slowly)\nbeing developed at rostools/manifesto.\nR Packages: Using the manifesto as a guide, to\nbuild an ecosystem of tools that automate as many aspects of doing an\nopen and reproducible research project and streamlining many other\naspects. An example of one of these packages is the prodigenr package.\nTeaching: To integrate the ecosystem of R packages\nwith a set of beginner-friendly and accessible training materials and\ndocumentation that future and current scientists can use to learn how to\nconduct reproducible and open science easily and simply. Developing and\nrunning workshops aimed at teaching researchers modern tools and skills\nto work openly and reproducibly. For an example of one of these\nprojects, check out the r-cubed teaching\nmaterial.\nOther projects related to teaching include two (completed and\nplanned) books of teaching material for Research Software Engineering in\nR and Python and two books of teaching material for Novice R and Python.\nSee the main website Merely\nUseful for links to these books.\n\n",
