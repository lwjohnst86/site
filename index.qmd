:wave: :wave: I am a diabetes epidemiologist, teacher, R user and
developer, and open science advocate. My work includes doing
epidemiological studies on type 2 diabetes and trying to improve
reproducibility and open science adherence in scientific studies through
training and software development. I value openness, transparency, and
accessibility. See my [current projects](projects.qmd) or my
[CV](https://cv.lukewjohnston.com) for more details about my work.
