:wave: :wave: I am a researcher, teacher, software developer, and open
science advocate :grin: :tada:

My current focus is on improving how data is structured and organized,
on reproducibility of studies, and open science adherence by using
training and education, software development of tools, and building
organizational and social infrastructures.

I *strongly* value openness, transparency, and accessibility. See my
[current projects](projects.qmd) or my
[CV](https://cv.lukewjohnston.com) for more details about my work.
