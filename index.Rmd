`r emo::ji("wave")` Welcome! <img src="images/luke-bio-pic.jpg" style="width:30%;border-radius:50%;float:right;padding-left:20px" alt="Luke's profile picture.">
I am a researcher, teacher, and R developer. My work includes doing epidemiological
studies on type 2 diabetes. I value openness, transparency, and accessibility.
See my [current projects](projects.html) or my [CV](https://cv.lukewjohnston.com)
for more details about my work.
