`r emo::ji("wave")` 
I am a diabetes epidemiologist, teacher, R user and developer, and open science
advocate. My work includes doing epidemiological studies on type 2 diabetes and
trying to improve reproducibility and open science adherence in scientific
studies through training and R package development. I value openness,
transparency, and accessibility. See my [current projects](projects.html) or my
[CV](https://cv.lukewjohnston.com) for more details about my work.
